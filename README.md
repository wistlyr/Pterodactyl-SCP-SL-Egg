# Pterodactyl SCP:SL Egg
A Pterodactyl egg for SCP: Secret Laboratory. Works with MP2.

This egg runs a **VANILLA** instance of SCP: Secret Laboratory ran through MultiAdmin.
LocalAdmin does **NOT** work with Pterodactyl on MP2. Any attempts to provide input will cause the server to hang and crash, so MultiAdmin is used as a "front end" with a compatibility tweak to enable input. SMod2 is not supported on MP2, and is not included with this egg.

You will need at least 3 GB of memory allocated to this server.

By default, SCP:SL uses port 7777. This can be changed with your port setting automatically.

**VERIFICATION WARNING**

This egg offers you a variable to add your email in order to have your server show up on the public server list. Before doing this, you must verify your server with the developers. Instructions are as follows:
* Make sure your server complies with the [verified server rules](https://scpslgame.com/Verified_server_rules.pdf).
* Send an email to `server.verification@scpslgame.com` from your configured contact email with the following information:
  1. The **public** IPv4 address of your server, with port. e.g. `69.69.69.69:7777`
  2. If the server's IP is static or dynamic.

If something breaks, ping me in the `#eggs` channel on the Pterodactyl Discord and I'll fix it. @wistlyr#6900.
